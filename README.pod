=head1 NAME

App::psst - prompt string setting tool

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Set-once configuration for F<~/.bashrc> to show presence of
C<$PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT>.

=head2 Origin

I wrote a L<local::lib>-based installer for a small project.

I added the obligatory "set up the environment and start a shell in
there" script.

I wanted the new subshell to be clearly marked as having local::lib
environment, and decided that this functionality doesn't belong in the
small project.

=head2 Intentions

Polish it a little to make a small CPAN-installable package.  Install
in all my $HOMEs.

=head2 Thanks

Thanks to Magnus Manske for some useful discussion of the mechanism,

and this post for convincing me that this is a useful route to sanity
http://blogs.perl.org/users/oliver_gorwits/2011/07/locallibs-for-dist-development.html

and to my employer for making it easy to mix free software with $work.
