NAME
    App::psst - prompt string setting tool

VERSION
    version 0.003015

DESCRIPTION
    Set-once configuration for ~/.bashrc to show presence of
    $PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT.

  Origin
    I wrote a local::lib-based installer for a small project.

    I added the obligatory "set up the environment and start a shell in
    there" script.

    I wanted the new subshell to be clearly marked as having local::lib
    environment, and decided that this functionality doesn't belong in the
    small project.

  Intentions
    Polish it a little to make a small CPAN-installable package. Install in
    all my $HOMEs.
